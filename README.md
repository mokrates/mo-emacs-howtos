mos emacs config
================

This is my emacs braindump.

You can read the files mostly on github by clicking on them. The
org-mode preview is not perfect, but kinda usable.

You can also go here: https://mokrates.github.io/mo-emacs-howtos/

To read it more nicely, clone the repo and export it to the format you
like. For example texinfo, odt or markdown.
