* Ansi-Term

** pasting

There is a function called ~term-paste~, but it is bound to ~S-insert~
by default. Who wants that? Use

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'term)
  (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c y") 'term-paste)
  (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c C-y") 'term-paste)
#+end_src

to rebind it to ~C-c C-y~

** tmacs
To conveniently open files from terminal even on remote machines, I
use [[https://github.com/mokrates/tmacs][tmacswrap]]

You can define a function to quickly open a tmacs-term with

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun tmacs--find-free-number ()
    "use this function to create a reasonable buffer name"
    (cl-do ((num 0 (+ 1 num)))
        ((not (get-buffer (format "*tmacs<%s>*" num)))
         num)))

  (defun tmacs ()
    (interactive)
    (ansi-term "/bin/bash" (format "tmacs<%s>" (tmacs--find-free-number))))
#+end_src
	
and then open it with ~M-x tmacs~.

** emacsclient
Add to your ~~/.bashrc~:
#+begin_src bash
  if [ -n "$INSIDE_EMACS" ]; then
      export VISUAL=emacsclient   # use tmacs here, if you want
      export EDITOR=$VISUAL
  fi  
#+end_src
	
Don't use ~emacsclient -n~ because that would confuse programs like
~git~ when you edit your commit messages with this.

** troubleshooting

*** slow scrolling (emacs 26.1 has this problem)

In older emacs versions ansi-term was allegedly very slow clearing the
screen. In version 26.1 the problem seems to be fixed, but still
triggered in a different way: Scrolling fast, if the terminal buffer
is already full. I solved this problem by using this[fn:1]

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; Terminal buffer configuration.
  (add-hook 'term-mode-hook 'my-term-mode-hook)
  (defun my-term-mode-hook ()
    ;; https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=20611
    (setq bidi-paragraph-direction 'left-to-right))  
#+end_src
		
*** terminal resizing (emacs 26.1 has this problem)

Resizing the terminal in which emacs runs doesn't inform inferior
terminals that they should be resized, too. Use this[fn:2]:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'window-configuration-change-hook (lambda (frame) (window--adjust-process-windows)))
#+end_src
